# Graduate-School-Admission-Analysis
A group work of analyzing a group of graduate school admission data using different machine learning models.
I was resiponsible for building, training and adjusting the parameters for the random forest classifier model, and wrote the correspondent part of the report. The FinalProj_RandomForestClassifier.ipynb is the random forest classifier part. The Final_Project_integration.ipynb has every part of the project, including other models programmed by froup members. The report is the final report for this project.
